# 👋 What's up, I'm Eric.
🕹️ I enjoy playing video games and I sometimes try to write programs to help me with doing things in those video games.\
Latest project: [Mapler](https://github.com/xreic/Mapler), a simple tracker app for Maplestory tasks and actions to complete.\
Planning on doing a web app version of Mapler, because having to re-install a program is cringe.\

😜 Shameless plug. Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/-ericlau/).
