# 👋 What's up, I'm Eric.
🕹️ I enjoy playing video games and I sometimes try to write programs to help me with doing things in those video games.\
Latest project: [guild-bot](https://github.com/xreic/guild-bot), a Discord bot that interfaces with the Sheets API to help me with some data entry.

😜 Shameless plug. Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/-ericlau/).
